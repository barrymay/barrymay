- Fun Fact: My first career position was in an early iteration of DevOps, way before the wonders of git and GitHub becmae a thing.   Back then, using SCCS, commands only worked on one file at a time, so you had to write whole systems to make the tool act like it was maintaining a folder-based, versioned, project! (and yes, I walked to work every day in the snow, uphill, and backwards for 20 miles each way ðŸŽ¿ !) 

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
