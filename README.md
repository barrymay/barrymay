### Hi there, I'm Barry.  Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my:
  - Career-spanning UI work in various sectors of the FinTech industry
  - OSS efforts as a member of the [React Hook Form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form) team
  - Experience giving back to my community as part of [iMentor](https://imentor.org/)

- ðŸ“« Reach to me at:
  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrymay/) (personalized connection invites only) OR
  - Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Barry_A_May)

- Fun Fact: My first career position (in the '90s) was in an early iteration of DevOps, well before git and GitHub became a thing.  Back then, using [SCCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System), commands only worked on one file at a time, without a GUI, so you had to write whole systems to make the tool act like it was maintaining a folder-based, versioned, project! (and yes, I walked to work every day in the snow, uphill, and backwards for 20 miles each way ðŸ˜‰ !) 

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
